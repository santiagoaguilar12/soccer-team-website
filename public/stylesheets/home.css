   /* The animation will be named imageAnimation, which matches with the value from our animation property in the .slideshow (unordered list) rule
  
  From 0% to 10% (the beginning of our animation) the list item begins changing it's opacity from 0 to 1 (invisible to visible)
  the animation-timing-function is set to ease-in at 0% and ease-out and 10%, this makes for a more smooth fade-in (read more about this here)
  The list item's opacity then stays at 1 until it reaches 20% at which point it fades back out, reaching 0 at 30% and staying at 0 for the remainder of the animation
  If we have 5 background images visible for 5 seconds each, then the time it takes to fade the image in and keep it visible is 10 seconds with a 5 second crossfade/fadeout into the next image; The entire animation cycle for all 5 images takes 50 seconds total
  100% divided by 5 is 20% so each image's fadein and visibility should last 20% of the cycle; half of 20% is 10%, that is why our fade in is from 0% to 10%, then we keep it visible until 20% is reached and begin the fadeout from 20% to 30%, the 5 second fadeout overlaps the next image's 5 second fadein, which is what creates the crossfade effect
  Lastly, we need to add animation support for older browsers; we've already added the modernizr CDN to our landing page's head element, now we just need the following rule in our landing.css
  
  
  /* Older browser support - .no-cssanimations class added by modernizr */
  .no-cssanimations .slideshow li {
      opacity: 1;
  }
